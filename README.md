Factorization Tool

This is the first web page I created for algorithmic practice. I port [my C program's source code](https://github.com/TravorLZH/cppstuff/blob/master/factor.c) to JavaScript, so the algorithm can be better visualized.

For more information, See also [TravorLZH/cppstuff](https://github.com/TravorLZH/cppstuff/blob/master/README.md)
